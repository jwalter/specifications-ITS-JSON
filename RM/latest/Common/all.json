    "description": "The common Reference Model comprises a number of packages containing abstract concepts and design patterns used in higher level openEHR models. Several concepts recur in higher level packages. The classes LOCATABLE and ARCHETYPED provide the link between information and archetype models. The classes ATTESTATION and PARTICIPATION are generic domain concepts that appear in various reference models. The change_control package defines a formal model of change management and versioning which applies to any service that needs to be able to supply previous states of its information, in particular the demographic and EHR services.",

Multiple `LINKs` can be attached to the root object of any archetyped structure to give the effect of a 1->N link.\n\n1:1 and 1:N relationships between archetyped content elements (e.g. `ENTRYs`) can be expressed by using one, or more than one, respectively, `LINKs`. Chains of links can be used to see  problem threads  or other logical groupings of items. \n\nLinks should be between archetyped structures only, i.e. between objects representing complete domain concepts because relationships between sub-elements of whole concepts are not necessarily meaningful, and may be downright confusing. Sensible links only exist between whole `ENTRYs`, `SECTIONs`, `COMPOSITIONs` and so on. ",
