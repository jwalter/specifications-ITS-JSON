    "description": "Abstract class defining the concept of ordered values, which includes ordinals as well as true quantities. It defines the functions  `<` and is_strictly_comparable_to, the latter of which must evaluate to `True` for instances being compared with the  `<` function, or used as limits in the `DV_INTERVAL<T>` class. \n\nData value types which are to be used as limits in the `DV_INTERVAL<T>` class must inherit from this class, and implement the function `_is_strictly_comparable_to_` to ensure that instances compare meaningfully. For example, instances of `DV_QUANTITY` can only be compared if they measure the same kind of physical quantity. \n",
