# specifications-ITS-JSON

JSON schemas for use with openEHR systems and tools. See https://www.openehr.org/programs/specification/workingbaseline[working baseline] of current specifications.

### IM Version
Schema files are generated directly from openEHR latest UML models of most relevant openEHR components.
These schemas are experimental and its format is based on https://json-schema.org/specification.html[draft-07 of JSON-Schema specifications].

### Additional JSON-Schema keywords
A few other keywords are used to support openEHR metadata: 
`$abstract`, `$inherits`, `$functions`, `$invariants`, `$version`, `$component`.
These don't have to be supported by JSON validators, their purpose is only informational.
